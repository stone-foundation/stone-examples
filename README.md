Welcome to the official **Stone.js Examples** repository, a collection of open-source projects built entirely with [Stone.js](https://stonejs.dev), the next-gen fullstack, cloud-native JavaScript framework.

This repo is your playground, your inspiration hub, and your reference point for building **real-world** applications with the full power of the **Continuum Architecture**.

---

## Why This Repo?

Stone.js is more than a framework, itâ€™s a philosophy.  
Here, we show what it means in action:

- **100% Cloud-Native**: Deploy to AWS Lambda, containers, or your local machine with no code change.
- **Backend + Frontend**: One brain, one flow. From API microservices to SSR/SPA React apps.
- **Zero node_modules**: Build once, deploy anywhere.
- **Modern JavaScript & TypeScript**: Class or function, decorator or pipeline, your style, your rules.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained project or demo.

| Folder                  | Description                                                               |

## About Stone.js
